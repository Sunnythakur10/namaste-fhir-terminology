# NAMASTE-FHIR Terminology Bridge: Use Case Narrative

## Executive Summary

The NAMASTE-FHIR Terminology Bridge addresses critical interoperability challenges in healthcare by providing seamless, bidirectional mapping between traditional AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) vocabularies and international ICD-11 standards. This solution enables dual-coding that preserves traditional medical knowledge while ensuring global healthcare interoperability.

## 1. The Gap: What is the Current Challenge?

### Problem Definition

Traditional medical systems face critical barriers that prevent their integration into modern healthcare ecosystems:

#### 1.1 Terminology Fragmentation
- **Challenge**: AYUSH medical systems use distinct vocabularies that don't map to international standards like ICD-11
- **Impact**: Creates data silos that prevent cross-system communication
- **Statistics**: 40% of global healthcare data remains fragmented due to terminology inconsistencies

#### 1.2 Interoperability Crisis
- **Challenge**: Healthcare providers cannot seamlessly share patient data across traditional and modern medical systems
- **Impact**: Limits coordinated care opportunities and comprehensive patient records
- **Consequence**: Fragmented healthcare delivery and potential safety risks

#### 1.3 Insurance Processing Complexity
- **Challenge**: Insurance companies struggle to process claims for traditional medicine treatments
- **Impact**: 60% longer claim processing times due to lack of standardized coding
- **Result**: Delayed reimbursements and coverage denials for traditional treatments

#### 1.4 Research Limitations
- **Challenge**: Public health researchers cannot effectively analyze morbidity patterns across medical systems
- **Impact**: Limited cross-system research capabilities
- **Outcome**: Missed opportunities for evidence-based traditional medicine validation

### Current State Impact
- **Data Fragmentation**: 40% of global healthcare data is isolated in system-specific silos
- **Processing Delays**: 60% longer claim processing for traditional medicine
- **Research Gaps**: Limited cross-system epidemiological studies
