# NAMASTE-FHIR Use Case Presentation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the improved Use Case Presentation interface that demonstrates the value proposition of the NAMASTE-FHIR Terminology Bridge through a clear problem-solution-demo narrative structure.

## Design Philosophy

The improved design follows a structured **Gap → Solution → Application** workflow that makes it easy for stakeholders to understand:

1. **What is the problem?** (The Gap)
2. **How do we solve it?** (Our Solution) 
3. **How can it be used?** (Live Demo)
4. **Where can it be applied?** (Real-World Applications)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Navigation Structure

- **Clear Step-by-Step Flow**: Navigation now shows "The Gap" → "Our Solution" → "Live Demo" → "Applications"
- **Visual Active States**: Current section is highlighted with distinctive styling
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Click-to-scroll navigation for seamless user experience

### 2. Hero Section with Value Proposition
