1. What ICD & NAMASTE actually are

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision):
A globally recognized coding framework published by WHO.

Covers all biomedical diseases (e.g., diabetes, anemia, psychiatric disorders).

Includes Chapter 26: Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) → introduces 529 diagnostic categories + 196 pattern codes specific to traditional medicine.

Primary purpose: standardized diagnosis, reporting, epidemiology, and billing.

NAMASTE (National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic):
India’s AYUSH-specific coding database.

Over 4,500 standardized Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani terms.

Developed for digitizing AYUSH morbidity data.

Not directly interoperable with global ICD-11 → hence the need for mapping.

2. Why integration matters

Problem today:
AYUSH doctors record cases in their own terms (e.g., Jwara for fever). Allopathy uses ICD-10/11 (e.g., Fever = “MG44”). Data stays siloed.

Solution:
A dual-coding system where:

NAMASTE → preserves authenticity of Ayurveda diagnosis.

ICD-11 TM2 / Biomedicine → makes it interoperable internationally.

Impact:

Clinical continuity → Patients moving between Ayurveda and modern medicine are understood consistently.

National analytics → Morbidity trends visible across systems.

Global interoperability → Indian AYUSH research joins global datasets.

Insurance + billing → Claims processed under ICD-11 compliant standards.

3. Real-life medical use cases

Clinical Diagnosis:

AYUSH doctor enters Raktakshaya Janya Pandu (anemia type in Ayurveda).

System auto-maps → ICD-11 code “5C70 – Iron deficiency anemia”.

Both codes saved in patient’s EMR.

Public Health Surveillance:

During an outbreak (e.g., dengue), government sees data from both AYUSH and Allopathy streams standardized under ICD-11.

Enables epidemic tracking, resource allocation (beds, oxygen, vaccines).

Research:

Comparative studies possible (e.g., how Ayurveda’s Madhumeha aligns with ICD-11’s E10–E14 Diabetes mellitus).

Facilitates clinical trials, population studies, outcome research.

Insurance/Claims:

Payers (insurance companies) accept ICD-11 codes.

AYUSH treatments, when coded in ICD-11, become eligible for reimbursement.

4. Doctor workflow (input/output)

Input:
Doctor enters symptoms (fever, fatigue, jaundice) or a diagnosis in local system (Jwara).

Processing:
Terminology microservice:

Looks up NAMASTE → ICD-11 TM2 / Biomedicine mappings.

Ensures compliance with ICD-11 coding rules (e.g., diagnosis + pattern).

Output (EMR):

Displays both terms side-by-side.

Stores both codes in FHIR ProblemList or Condition resources.

5. Technical system behavior

Terminology Microservice Features:

FHIR R4 API: Provides CodeSystem, ValueSet, ConceptMap.

Auto-complete lookup: Clinician types → suggestions from both NAMASTE + ICD-11.

Translate Operation: Converts NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 TM2 codes.

Bundle ingestion: Accepts dual-coded encounters in EMR.

Security: OAuth 2.0 via ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account), ISO 22600 access control.

Audit-ready: Consent, versioning, and traceability for medico-legal safety.

✅ In short:
You are not just making a translator. You are making a FHIR-compliant terminology bridge that:

Preserves traditional AYUSH vocabularies.

Standardizes them into ICD-11 for global interoperability.

Supports clinical care, research, insurance, and public health surveillance.
