Title: Develop APIs to Integrate NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2) into FHIR-Compliant EMR Systems Aligned with India’s EHR Standards

Background

India’s AYUSH sector is undergoing a digital transformation, moving from paper-based systems to interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Central to this transition are two standardized coding frameworks:

NAMASTE (National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic): Contains 4,500+ standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani.

ICD-11 (WHO International Classification of Diseases, Chapter 26 – TM2): Includes 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes for traditional medicine, integrated into the global ICD framework.

Harmonizing these vocabularies within EMR platforms enables:

Accurate clinical documentation and decision support.

Compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards, which mandate FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT/LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and audit trails for consent and versioning.

A terminology microservice is required that:

Ingests NAMASTE CSVs.

Synchronizes with the WHO ICD-11 API (covering both Biomedicine and TM2).

Provides EMR interfaces with auto-complete diagnosis widgets returning both NAMASTE and ICD-11 codes.

Supports dual/double-coding: one for traditional medicine (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani) and another for Biomedicine.

This integration will:

Empower clinicians with both traditional and biomedical insights.

Facilitate AYUSH insurance claims under ICD-11 standards.

Enable real-time morbidity analytics for the Ministry of Ayush aligned with global reporting frameworks.

Problem Description

Design and prototype an API integration layer to bring together:

NAMASTE terminologies,

WHO standardized international terminology for Ayurveda, and

ICD-11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 + Biomedicine).

This API must operate within a FHIR-compliant EMR system, enabling clinicians to record AYUSH diagnoses with NAMASTE codes and automatically map them to ICD-11 identifiers for interoperability, analytics, and insurance purposes.

Deliverables

A lightweight microservice or FHIR terminology plugin that provides:

FHIR-compliant CodeSystem for NAMASTE, linked to WHO terminologies and ICD-11 TM2/Biomedicine.

REST endpoint for auto-complete value-set lookup.

Translation operation: NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 TM2.

Encounter upload API to ingest FHIR Bundles with both coding systems.

OAuth 2.0–secured access via ABHA tokens, with audit-ready metadata.

Team Demonstrations

Participants should demonstrate the following:

Ingesting NAMASTE CSVs and generating FHIR CodeSystem + ConceptMap.

Fetching ICD-11 TM2 and Biomedicine updates via WHO ICD-API and merging them.

Providing a CLI or web interface to:

Search NAMASTE and WHO Ayurveda terminologies.

View mapped TM2 codes.

Construct FHIR ProblemList entries.

Version tracking and consent metadata in line with India’s 2016 EHR Standards (FHIR R4, ISO 22600, SNOMED CT/LOINC compliance).

Expected Solution

A FHIR R4–compliant terminology microservice, adhering to India’s 2016 EHR Standards, with:

NAMASTE CodeSystem.

WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda.

ICD-11 TM2 & Biomedicine ConceptMap.

Auto-complete value-set lookup endpoint.

NAMASTE ↔ TM2 translation operation.

Secure FHIR Bundle upload interface to support dual coding.
