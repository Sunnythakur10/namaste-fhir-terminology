Proposal: Two-Layer Demo Approach

1. API Engine Website (Core “Brain”)

This will be similar to API Setu, but specialized for NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 TM2/Biomedicine translation.

Features:

REST APIs documented (Swagger/Redoc).

Endpoints:

/search → search NAMASTE/ICD terms.

/translate → bidirectional mapping (NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 TM2/Biomedicine).

/autocomplete → for doctor UI integration.

/fhir-upload → accept FHIR Bundles with dual coding.

FHIR Terminology resources exposed: CodeSystem, ValueSet, ConceptMap.

Authentication: OAuth2.0 with ABHA token simulation.

Audit logs: show consent/versioning (basic demo).

Tech stack: Django REST API (or FastAPI), Postgres/SQLite for codes, WHO ICD-API sync, Swagger UI for live testing.

2. Sandbox Demo UI (Use-Case Layer)

A lightweight front-end web app that consumes the above API.

Purpose: to show practical use cases for doctors, researchers, insurers, government evaluators.

Scenarios:

Doctor workflow: Type “Amlapitta” → auto-complete suggests NAMASTE + ICD-11 TM2 mapping → save to “Problem List.”

Researcher workflow: Query prevalence of codes → export in FHIR JSON/CSV.

Insurance workflow: Show ICD-11 compliant claim eligibility.

Tech stack: React (or Django templates for speed), connected to API Engine endpoints.

This UI is not a full EMR—just a sandbox demo proving how the engine can plug into real systems.

Why This Approach?

Judges see both layers:

Backend Engine (serious, technical, standards-compliant).

Frontend Sandbox (real-world impact, user-facing).

Matches real-world adoption model:

National API registries (like API Setu) provide core APIs.

Ecosystem apps/systems build on those APIs for doctors, insurers, public health.

Keeps scope manageable: we don’t build everything, we just prove the translation brain + use-case showcase.
