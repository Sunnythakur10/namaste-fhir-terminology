Proposed Terminology Translation Framework
Integrating AYUSH (traditional Indian medicine) terms with global standards demands a robust, standardsbased solution. We propose a FHIR-based terminology service that uses HL7’s ConceptMap (and related
Terminology resources) to map NAMASTE/Ayush morbidity codes bi-directionally to ICD-11 (including the
new Traditional Medicine chapter). This leverages existing interoperability standards (FHIR, ICD-11, ISO
coding) and builds a repeatable, API-driven protocol. The framework would ensure that each AYUSH
diagnosis can be reliably translated into an ICD-11 code (and vice versa), preserving meaning and clinical
nuance.
Scope and Background
Figure: Timeline of AYUSH terminology standardization leading up to ICD-11 Traditional Medicine (TM) integration.
India’s NAMASTE portal (launched 2017) consolidated standardized morbidity codes for Ayurveda, Siddha
and Unani . Subsequent efforts (2017–2024) refined these terminologies and prepared for global
integration . In 2025 WHO officially released the ICD-11 update with a TM chapter, enabling optional
dual coding of traditional medicine diagnoses . In practice this means a patient encounter can be coded
with both a NAMASTE (AYUSH) code and a corresponding ICD-11 code, allowing comprehensive data
collection on TM use. WHO explicitly notes that the TM chapter “is used only for optional dual coding in the
morbidity data collection (e.g. morbidity reporting, reimbursement, patient safety, research)” . In short,
the global environment now supports systematic digitization of AYUSH diagnoses alongside conventional
diagnoses, a capability our framework will exploit.
International Standards Alignment
Our protocol builds on ICD-11’s Traditional Medicine chapter and the broader WHO classification. The
WHO FAQ emphasizes that including TM in ICD-11 allows “digitization of Traditional Medicine diagnostic
data and easier integration into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems,” as well as “better integration of
Traditional Medicine diagnostic data in adverse-event reporting, insurance coverage and
reimbursement” . In other words, mapping AYUSH terms into ICD-11 ties Indian TM practice into the
international health-data infrastructure. By aligning with ICD-11 and other ISO/HL7 standards, our
framework meets regulatory goals (e.g. digital health strategies, Universal Health Coverage) and enables
country-to-country comparability of TM data .
Technical Architecture
The core of the solution is an API-based translation service using HL7 FHIR Terminology resources. The
steps are:
CodeSystem definitions: Publish the AYUSH term set (from NAMASTE) and the ICD-11 code system
(including TM chapter codes) as FHIR CodeSystem and ValueSet resources. These define all valid
codes in each system.

ConceptMap resources: Create FHIR ConceptMaps that explicitly map AYUSH codes to ICD-11
codes. Each ConceptMap entry links a source concept (e.g. an Ayurveda diagnosis code) to one or
more target concepts in ICD-11, with a relationship qualifier (e.g. equivalent, narrower, broader)
to capture semantic nuance. For example, an Ayurvedic condition might map as “equivalent” to a
specific ICD-11 code if meanings align, or “narrower than” if the ICD code is more general .
(Mappings that lack a good ICD-11 counterpart could be flagged as unmapped or map to a broader
category.) The FHIR ConceptMap model supports recording these relationships and any provenance
data. As HL7 notes, “a concept map defines a mapping from a set of concepts in a code system… to
one or more concepts in other code systems” , with a formal relationship to describe each
pairing . 
Terminology Server / APIs: Host these resources on a FHIR Terminology Service. Conformant FHIR
servers provide built-in operations (e.g. $translate , $lookup ) to query code mappings and
validate codes. A terminology service “is simply a set of functions built on the definitions provided by
a collection of CodeSystem, ValueSet and ConceptMap resources” . Once deployed, any client
(EHR, mobile app, public health system) can call a RESTful API (e.g. /ConceptMap/$translate?
source=...&code=... ) to get the mapped code(s). For example, a provider entering a NAMASTE
code could automatically retrieve the ICD-11 equivalent. The service would be secured (e.g. OAuth2/
TLS) and offer audit logs for compliance. 
Key architecture elements can be summarized:
Terminology Repository: A FHIR server storing CodeSystem and ConceptMap artifacts, ideally
under an implementation guide or namespace. 
APIs: FHIR REST endpoints for $translate , code validation ( ValueSet/$expand , 
CodeSystem/lookup ), etc. 
Data Flow: EHR systems submit AYUSH codes or queries; the translation API returns matching
ICD-11 codes (and vice versa). The dual coding is recorded in patient records or aggregated reports.
Example: In FHIR, a ConceptMap entry might link NAMASTE:AYU12345 (an Ayurveda “lower back pain”
code) to ICD-11:ME05.1 with a relationship “equivalent”. The terminology service’s $translate
operation would use this ConceptMap to answer queries: e.g. /ConceptMap/$translate?
code=NAMASTE:AYU12345&system=NAMASTE → returns {code: ME05.1, display: 
"Lumbago" (ICD-11)} .
Ensuring Semantic and Clinical Accuracy
Semantic interoperability requires careful curation. We would engage clinical experts in Ayurveda, Siddha,
etc., to vet mappings. Each ConceptMap element can carry equivalence (or relationship ) levels to
reflect how close a match is . For instance, if an Indian term has no exact Western analogue, it might
map to a broader ICD-11 category (with broaderMatch ) or even be left unmapped with a note for review.
By explicitly encoding these relationships, the framework avoids false equivalences. Moreover, because
mappings are context-sensitive, we recommend versioning and contextual qualifiers (e.g. depending on
patient age, symptom context). The concept of FHIR ConceptMaps supports dependent mappings (multiple
targets or condition-based mapping) and provenance (who authored the map). With FHIR’s expressive
model, we can document these nuances so that implementers (or even machine-learning QA tools) know if
a mapping is exact or approximate .

Implementation and Use Cases
This protocol can be implemented in stages, supporting multiple contexts:
EHR and Clinical Coding: Clinicians enter AYUSH diagnoses using NAMASTE codes in the EHR. The
system calls the terminology API to retrieve the ICD-11 code for that condition. Both codes are
stored in the patient record (dual coding), enabling AYUSH practitioners to document in their own
terms while making the data usable for billing and analytics. NAMASTE itself envisions a “futuristic
double coding system” using both ASU codes and ICD-10/11 . This ensures clinical accuracy in
documentation and meets coding requirements for integrations. 
Public Health and Reporting: Aggregated statistics on disease burden can use ICD-11 as the
common language. For example, AYUSH clinics reporting monthly morbidity would send ICD-11
codes (translated from NAMASTE codes) into national health databases. This permits consistent
epidemiology across conventional and traditional medicine. WHO notes that counting TM
encounters and enabling international comparability is a key benefit of the ICD-11 TM chapter .
Our service automates that translation, so public-health systems can ingest mixed data and
categorize AYUSH cases under ICD codes. 
Research and Analytics: Researchers conducting integrative medicine studies can merge AYUSH
trial data with global data sets via ICD-11. The translation service provides a systematic “crosswalk”
so that outcomes coded in traditional terms become analyzable with conventional health statistics.
This fosters evidence-based policy: as one senior AYUSH official notes, dual coding “improves data
collection” and “fosters evidence-based policymaking” for traditional medicine . 
Insurance and Policy: Indian health policy is already exploring insurance coverage for AYUSH
treatments. By mapping to ICD-11, insurers can align AYUSH claims with global diagnostic
categories. Indeed, NAMASTE aims to integrate TM into reimbursement systems . For example,
an insurer might only recognize ICD codes for claims; our translation allows a clinic to bill under the
correct ICD-11 code for an AYUSH treatment, streamlining claims. This respects regulations: ICD-11
coding can be used for non-mortality purposes like reimbursement , and NAMASTE explicitly
supports reporting of AYUSH services in standard formats .
Regulatory and Security Considerations
Our framework is designed to comply with Indian and global regulations. In India, the Ayushman Bharat
Digital Mission (ABDM) mandates use of open standards (FHIR, SNOMED, LOINC, ICD) for all health data
exchanges. The ABDM FHIR Implementation Guide explicitly “refers to relevant standards and coding
systems… such as EHR Standards for India (2016)” . By using HL7 FHIR and WHO’s ICD-11, we align with
ABDM and MoHFW directives. The service would require patient consent (as per Indian privacy law) before
translating or sharing identifiable health data.
Security measures include OAuth2 authentication for API access, TLS encryption for all data in transit, and
audit logging of requests. HL7 guidance notes that even terminology servers should use SSL/TLS, since
“observers may be able to infer information about patients by observing the codes… so encryption is still
recommended” . We would enforce role-based access (only authorized providers or systems can call the
service) and record all translations in an audit trail. Data at rest (e.g. the ConceptMap definitions) would be
hosted on a secure server (cloud or on-premises) compliant with healthcare IT regulations (e.g. HIPAA in the
US, proposed Digital Health Data Protection laws in India).

Compliance with clinical standards is ensured by relying on approved code sets. NAMASTE codes are
issued by MoA (along with English definitions), and ICD-11 is maintained by WHO. Any mappings would be
reviewed by a joint committee (including clinical experts and informatics specialists) to ensure they meet
medical guidelines. The FHIR resources themselves are standard artifacts that can be version-controlled and
updated through normal governance (e.g. a new NAMASTE release or ICD-11 update simply leads to
updated resources).
Key Components (Summary)
HL7 FHIR Terminology Service: Hosts CodeSystem (NAMASTE, ICD-11), ValueSet, and ConceptMap
resources. Supports $translate and related operations . 
ConceptMap Mappings: AYUSH-to-ICD and ICD-to-AYUSH ConceptMap resources, with explicit 
relationship labels for semantic accuracy . Optionally, a single ConceptMap can include
bidirectional groups. 
FHIR API Layer: A RESTful interface for applications to query codes. Must support OAuth2 scopes
(e.g. translate:read ) and return JSON. 
Governance Process: A workflow for domain experts to propose, vet, and publish mappings.
ConceptMap metadata can record author, date, and mapping rationale. 
Integration Hooks: Adaptors or FHIR clients in EHRs and health apps to call the translation service
when needed (e.g. on code entry, or on data export). 
Practical Use Cases
AYUSH Clinic (EHR Integration): An Ayurvedic physician documents “Amaja shula” (digestive colic)
using the NAMASTE code AYU123. The EHR calls our service’s ConceptMap $translate API, which
returns ICD-11 code “DK90 Digestive colic” (for example). The system records both codes. If later the
patient is referred to a general hospital, the ICD code ensures other clinicians understand the
diagnosis. 
Public Health Dashboard: Monthly HMIS reports from AYUSH units come coded with ICD-11 (via our
service). The Ministry of Health can then aggregate AYUSH and allopathic cases seamlessly, meeting
WHO’s push for integrated data . 
Research Study: A multi-center study on “integrative treatment of arthritis” uses both Ayurveda and
Western diagnostics. Investigators use our service to cross-tabulate AYUSH symptoms to ICD-11
rheumatologic categories, enabling combined analysis of efficacy. 
Insurance Claim Processing: An insurance scheme recognizes ICD-11 codes for reimbursement. An
Ayurvedic hospital submits claims using ICD-11 codes obtained via the translation service, facilitating
payout. This supports NAMASTE’s goal of extending insurance to AYUSH treatments .
Security and Privacy
All service endpoints use HTTPS with strong ciphers. User authentication (e.g. via OAuth2 bearer tokens)
ensures only authorized actors (clinics, health departments, researchers) may translate codes. Audit logs
record the user ID, timestamp, and codes translated. No patient-identifying information needs to be sent to
this service (only coded diagnoses), minimizing privacy risk. Nevertheless, encrypting these requests is
recommended since inferences could potentially be made (for example, a very rare code might hint at a
patient’s identity). The system will comply with data protection laws (for India: IT Act and forthcoming
Digital Health Act; for other regions: GDPR, HIPAA) by design.

Conclusion
By leveraging HL7 FHIR and WHO ICD-11, we can build a standardized, bi-directional translation protocol
for AYUSH terminologies. The proposed FHIR Terminology Service (ConceptMaps, CodeSystems) provides a
technical backbone that is already widely adopted and tested for interoperability . This ensures
semantic interoperability: codes from diverse medical paradigms are linked in a computable way. Clinical
accuracy is maintained through explicit relationship semantics and expert validation. Regulatory
compliance is met by aligning with national digital health guidelines (ABDM/NDHM) and international
standards. In practice, this framework will let Indian traditional medicine practitioners participate fully in
the digital health ecosystem—entering diagnoses in familiar terms while simultaneously populating
standardized health records. Over time, broader adoption can enable richer data analytics and integrative
health insights, fulfilling WHO and national goals for inclusive health information. 
Sources: We base this design on the NAMASTE initiative and WHO’s ICD-11 updates , and on
HL7 FHIR standards documentation . All mappings and APIs would be version-controlled and
open-access to ensure transparency and continual improvement.
