NAMASTE / ICD-11 Master Dataset

Files
- `disease_master.csv` — Combined master with columns: `icd_code, icd_name, namaste_code, namaste_name, source`.
- `../dataset/namaste_dummy_dataset.csv` — Example NAMASTE clinical dataset (patient rows).
- `../dataset/AYUSH.csv` — AYUSH-to-ICD-11 mapping reference that can be used to enrich the master.

How it was created
- The `disease_master.csv` was generated by combining `dataset/namaste_dummy_dataset.csv` (NAMASTE terms appearing in patient data) and `dataset/AYUSH.csv` (AYUSH to ICD-11 TM2 mappings).
- For NAMASTE rows without explicit ICD mappings in the patient CSV, we used placeholder or best-effort ICD mappings derived from `dataset/AYUSH.csv` where possible.

How to update
1. If you have a richer NAMASTE dataset (CSV), upload it to `dataset/` and re-run the ingestion script (or manually merge into `data/disease_master.csv`).
2. If you obtain official ICD-11 mappings, update the `icd_code` and `icd_name` columns accordingly.

Usage
- The API endpoints (to be added/updated in `main.py`) will read `data/disease_master.csv` to power auto-complete and translate endpoints.
- This master file is intentionally small for demo purposes; consider migrating to a real database (Postgres / SQLite) for production use.
