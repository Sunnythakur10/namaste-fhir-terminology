#### 2. Intelligent Search System (/search & /valueset-lookup endpoints)

**Example: Searching for "Diabetes"**
```json
{
  "query": "Diabetes",
  "total_results": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "namaste_code": "EF-2.4.4",
      "display_name": "Madhumeha/Kshaudrameha",
      "definition": "Diabetes Mellitus",
      "mappings": {
        "icd11_tm2": "SJ00",
        "icd11_biomedicine": "5A11"
      },
      "match_info": {
        "confidence_score": 100,
        "match_type": "exact"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**FHIR ValueSet Expansion:**
```json

          {
            "url": "icd11_tm2",
            "valueCode": "SJ00"
          },
          {
            "url": "icd11_biomed",
            "valueCode": "5A11"
          }
